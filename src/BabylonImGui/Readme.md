# BabylonImGui

This library groups :

* a widget based on [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/) that is able to display a 3d scene (`imgui_scene_widget`)
* the OpenGl backend for BabylonCpp (gl_rendering_context)
* an implementation of BABYLON::ICanvas that is able to render in an OpenGl framebuffer, i.e an offscreen texture (`framebuffer_canvas`)
* the babylon inspector widgets
